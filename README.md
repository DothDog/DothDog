In the shadows of the night, where sorrow weaves its web,
A soul entwined with despair, a heart that longs to ebb.
Beneath the veil of moonlight, a specter lost in gloom,
A haunted melody, a dirge of impending doom.

The raven's wings unfurl, a messenger of woe,
Whispering secrets of a sorrowful undertow.
In the chambers of my mind, where echoes never cease,
Resides a somber symphony, a lament without release.

A graveyard of dreams, where hope lies cold and still,
The specter of desolation, a void that time can't fill.
A pallor on the visage, like moonlight drained of life,
A dance with shadows, a silent, mournful strife.

The pendulum swings, a metronome of despair,
Tick-tock, the hours pass, in this desolate lair.
A tale woven in anguish, like threads of blackened silk,
A requiem for joy, a dirge for dreams of milk.

In the pit of despair, where demons softly weep,
A soul entangled in the night, in shadows dark and deep.
A sonnet to sadness, a ballad to the abyss,
In the tapestry of sorrow, where darkness finds its kiss.

Quoth the raven, evermore, a mantra of the night,
A lamentation echoing, in the absence of the light.
In the sepulcher of silence, where echoes softly fade,
A melancholic sonnet, to a soul forever swayed.
